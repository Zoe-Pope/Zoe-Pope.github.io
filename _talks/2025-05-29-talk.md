I gave this talk in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/talbotworkshop/past-talbots/talbot-2025?authuser=0" target="_blank">Talbot 2025</a> workshop on homological stability, mentored by Alexander Kupers and Nathalie Wahl. My talk notes can be found [here](files/Talbot2025-TalkNotes.pdf), which was mainly based off the original article by Randal-Williams and Wahl <a href="https://web.math.ku.dk/~wahl/Autstability.pdf" target="_blank">[RWW17]</a> and Wahl's ICM paper <a href="https://web.math.ku.dk/~wahl/ICM22.pdf" target="_blank">[Wah23]</a>.

The Randal-Williams–Wahl machine is a tool for proving homological stability theorems for families of groups. Echoing classical results, the method axiomatizes conditions sufficient to apply Quillen’s spectral sequence argument and obtain homological stability theorems. I first detailed the setting of modules over braided monoidal groupoids where one creates a family of groups of interest. I then introduced the `space of destabilizations,' a semisimplicial set integral to Quillen's spectral sequence argument. Finally, I concluded by proving the main theorem given in <a href="https://web.math.ku.dk/~wahl/Autstability.pdf" target="_blank">[RWW17]</a>, showing that from a carefully constructed spectral sequence of a double complex one can prove a homological stability theorem.
