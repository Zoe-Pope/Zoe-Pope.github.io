I gave this talk at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/talbotworkshop/past-talbots/talbot-2025?authuser=0" target="_blank">Talbot 2025</a> workshop on homological stability, mentored by Alexander Kupers and Nathalie Wahl. My talk notes can be found [here](https://zoe-pope.github.io/files/Talbot2025-TalkNotes.pdf), and are mainly based off the [original article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aim.2017.07.022) by Randal-Williams and Wahl and Wahl's [ICM paper](https://doi.org/10.4171/ICM2022/137).

A sequence of groups $$G_1 \to G_2 \to \cdots$$ exhibits homological stability if the induced maps on homology $$H_i(G_n) \to H_i(G_{n+1})$$ are isomorphisms for $$n$$ large relative to $$i$$. In the talk, we explored an axiomatization due to Oscar Randal-Williams and Nathalie Wahl of conditions on the groups $$G_n$$ that imply homological stability, and showed how this applies to classical groups of interest. We then explained Quillen’s spectral sequence argument and how it gives a proof of homological stability in the Randal-Williams--Wahl setup.
