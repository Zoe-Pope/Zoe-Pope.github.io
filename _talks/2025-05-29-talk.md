I gave this talk in the Talbot 2025 workshop on homological stability, mentored by Alexander Kupers and Nathalie Wahl. The Randal-Williams–Wahl machine is a tool for proving homological stability theorems for families of groups. Echoing classical results, the method axiomatizes conditions sufficient to apply Quillen’s spectral sequence argument and obtain homological stability theorems. I first detailed the setting of modules over braided monoidal groupoids where one creates a family of groups of interest. I then introduced the `space of destabilizations,' a semisimplicial set integral to Quillen's spectral sequence argument. Finally, I concluded by proving the main theorem given in [RWW17], showing that from a carefully constructed spectral sequence of a double complex one can prove a homological stability theorem.
