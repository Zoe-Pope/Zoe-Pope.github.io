This talk was given as part of attendance in Talbot 2025, centered on the topic of homological stability. I gave motivation and set up the axiomatization of proving homological stability in a range for a given sequence of groups satisfying some properties. First, the general setting of braided monoidal groupoids were introduced followed by giving its `space of destabilizations' needed to apply Quillen's spectral sequence argument.
