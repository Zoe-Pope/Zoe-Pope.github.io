I gave this talk in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/talbotworkshop/past-talbots/talbot-2025?authuser=0" target="_blank">Talbot 2025</a> workshop on homological stability, mentored by Alexander Kupers and Nathalie Wahl. My talk notes can be found [here](https://zoe-pope.github.io/files/Talbot2025-TalkNotes.pdf), which was mainly based off the <a href="https://web.math.ku.dk/~wahl/Autstability.pdf" target="_blank">original article</a> by Randal-Williams and Wahl and Wahl's <a href="https://web.math.ku.dk/~wahl/ICM22.pdf" target="_blank">ICM paper</a>.

A sequence of groups $$G_1 \to G_2 \to \cdots$$ exhibits homological stability if the induced maps on homology $$H_i(G_n) \to H_i(G_{n+1})$$ are isomorphisms for $$n$$ large relative to~$$i$$. In the talk, we explored an axiomatization due to Oscar Randal-Williams and Nathalie Wahl of conditions on the groups~$$G_n$$ that imply homological stability, and showed how this applies to classical groups of interest. We then explained Quillen’s spectral sequence argument and how it gives a proof of homological stability in the Randal-Williams--Wahl setup.
