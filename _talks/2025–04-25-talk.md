Topological data analysis employs an `interleaving distance' between persistence spaces as a means of measuring when two such objects are approximately isomorphic. By generalizing this notion to homotopy interleavings, one can instead measure when persistent spaces are approximately weakly equivalent. [Michael Lesnick and Andrew Blumberg](https://http://doi.org/10.1090/tran/8738) developed a universal homotopy interleaving distance and conjectured that it differed from the interleaving distance on a homotopy category by at most a multiplicative constant. The conjecture was later proved by [Edoardo Lanari and Luis Scoccola](https://doi.org/10.2140/agt.2023.23.803). I gave motivation and proof of this conjecture, stating the homotopy interleaving distance on $$\textnormal{Fun}(\mathbb{Z},Spc)$$ is within a multiplicative constant of the interleaving distance on $$\textnormal{Fun}(\mathbb{Z},\textnormal{Ho}(Spc))$$. I also detailed the failure of this phenomenon for multi-persistent spaces.
