Topological data analysis employs an `interleaving distance' between persistence spaces as a means of measuring when two such objects are approximately isomorphic. By generalizing this notion to homotopy interleavings, one can instead measure when persistent spaces are approximately weakly equivalent. In 2023, [Andrew Blumberg and Michael Lesnick](https://doi.org/10.1090/tran/8738) developed a universal homotopy interleaving distance. They additionally conjectured that this homotopy interleaving distance differed from the interleaving distance on a homotopy category by at most a multiplicative constant, which was later proved by [Edoardo Lanari and Luis Scoccola](https://doi.org/10.2140/agt.2023.23.803). We covered the proof of this conjecture and detailed the failure of this phenomenon for multi-persistent spaces.
