Topological data analysis employs an `interleaving distance' between persistence spaces as a means of measuring when two such objects are approximately isomorphic. This was built upon by [Michael Lesnick and Andrew Blumberg](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1705.01690) in 2023. By lifting this notion to homotopy interleavings, one can measure when persistent spaces are approximately weakly equivalent. I gave the motivation and proof of Theorem A, which gives an interplay between the homotopy interleaving distance within the category of persistent spaces and the interleaving distance within its homotopy category. I also detailed the failure of this phenomenon when examining bipersistent spaces and more generally multi-persistent spaces. My talk in total covered section 3 of the aformentioned paper.
