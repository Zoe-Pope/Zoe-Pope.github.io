We explored the global orbit $\infty$-category $Orb$ of arbitrary discrete groups. We began by showing the orbit (1-)category $\mathcal{O}(G)$ for a fixed $G$ can be identified with the slice $\infty$-category $Orb_{/G}$. We then used this equivalence to give purely categorical proofs for known results about assembly maps, like the transitivity principle.
