I am a mathematics graduate student at the University at Albany, SUNY, working with <a href="https://varisco.info" target="_blank">Marco Varisco</a>. My interests lie in ∞-category theory and equivariant homotopy theory. I am currently thinking about the global orbit ∞-category.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the University at Albany, SUNY, in the spring of 2024.
