I am a mathematics graduate student at SUNY University at Albany under the advisement of [Marco Varisco](https://varisco.info). My interests lie in higher category theory and homotopy theory. I am currently thinking about the global orbit ∞-category.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from SUNY University at Albany in the spring of 2024.
