I am a mathematics graduate student at University at Albany, SUNY under the advisement of  <a href="https://varisco.info" target="_blank">Marco Varisco</a>. My interests lie in ∞-category theory and homotopy theory. I am currently thinking about the global orbit ∞-category.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from University at Albany, SUNY in the spring of 2024.
